Majority of components in library support content density features.\\n\\nDesign system provides three content density modes:\\n\\n- *Cozy* \\\\- displays controls with dimensions large enough to enable fingertip interaction. This factor can be used in touch screen devices\\n- *Compact* \\\\- reduces the dimensions of the component, focusing more on the information displayed. This factor can be used in devices operated by a mouse or keyboard.\\n- *Condensed* \\\\- reduces the dimensions of the components and the space between letters. This factor can be used on small screens\\n\\nMost of the Components support `compact` mode, they can be rendered with smaller sizes, margins and paddings in order to preserve as much space as possible.\\nTo enable compact mode, use the class `.is-compact` on the `body`, `html` or any other relevant region of your application.\\n\\nMore information about the content density can be found in the [SAP Fiori Design Guidelines](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/cozy-compact).\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nTo render entire page in compact mode, use the class `.is-compact` on the `body` element.\\n\\n```html\\n<body class=\\\"is-compact\\\">\\n<button class=\\\"fd-button\\\">Button is compact</button>\\n</body>\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to render only a section of the page in compact mode, use the class `.is-compact` on the relevant element.\\n\\n```html\\n<body>\\n<div class=\\\"fd-card\\\" role=\\\"region\\\" aria-label=\\\"Card Anatomy Example 1\\\">\\n    <a class=\\\"fd-card__header\\\" tabindex=\\\"0\\\">\\n        <span\\n            class=\\\"fd-avatar fd-avatar--s fd-avatar--circle fd-avatar--thumbnail fd-card__avatar\\\"\\n            style=\\\"background-image: url('/assets/images/backgrounds/city.jpg')\\\"\\n            role=\\\"img\\\"\\n            aria-label=\\\"John Doe\\\"></span>\\n        <div class=\\\"fd-card__header-text\\\">\\n            <div class=\\\"fd-card__title-area\\\">\\n                <div class=\\\"fd-card__title\\\">Card Title</div>\\n                <span class=\\\"fd-object-status fd-card__counter\\\">Counter</span>\\n            </div>\\n            <div class=\\\"fd-card__subtitle-area\\\">\\n                <div class=\\\"fd-card__subtitle\\\">Card Subtitle</div>\\n            </div>\\n        </div>\\n    </a>\\n    <div class=\\\"fd-card__content\\\" role=\\\"group\\\" aria-label=\\\"Card Content\\\"></div>\\n    <div class=\\\"fd-card__footer is-compact\\\">\\n        <!--Everything in this footer is compact-->\\n        <div class=\\\"fd-card__footer-actions\\\">\\n            <button class=\\\"fd-button fd-button--positive\\\">\\n                Button\\n            </button>\\n            <button class=\\\"fd-button fd-button--negative\\\">\\n                Button\\n            </button>\\n        </div>\\n    </div>\\n</div>\\n</body>\\n```\\n\\nYou can also use the class `.is-cozy` when you want to render a section of the page with larger sizes, margins and paddings.\\n\\n```html\\n<body class=\\\"is-compact\\\">\\n<button class=\\\"fd-button\\\">Button is compact</button>\\n<button class=\\\"fd-button is-cozy\\\">Button is cozy</button>\\n</body>\\n```\\n\\nSome components also support the `condensed` mode, but if the component, under the `is-codensed` does not support it, they will fall back to\\n`compact` mode.\\n\\n```html\\n<body class=\\\"is-condensed\\\">\\n<button class=\\\"fd-button\\\">Button is visually compact</button>\\n<table class=\\\"fd-table\\\">\\n    <!--Table is visually condensed, because it supports condensed mode-->\\n</table>\\n</body>\\n```\\nIf any element does not have the content density specifier class on it's own, then it will be inherited from the parent element and if it has one, any of it's children,\\non any level of nesting will have the same content density mode, if not specified otherwise.\\n\\n```html\\n<body class=\\\"is-compact\\\">\\n    <div>\\n        <div>\\n            <button class=\\\"fd-button\\\">Button is compact</button>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\\\"is-cozy\\\">\\n            <div>\\n                <button class=\\\"fd-button\\\">Button is cozy</button>\\n            </div>\\n            <button class=\\\"fd-button is-compact\\\">This will be compact</button>\\n        </div>\\n    </div>\\n</body>\\n```\\n\""],"names":["Readme"],"mappings":"uZAAA,MAAeA,EAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;;;;;;;"}
