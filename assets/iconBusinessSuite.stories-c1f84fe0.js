They are often used as visual elements within other components, although they can be used independently, given that they can be read by screen readers or have a tooltip for accessibility purposes. See [Project Confirguration](https://sap.github.io/fundamental-styles/?path=/docs/introduction-overview--page) for instructions on how to use the 'BusinessSuiteInAppSymbols' icon font on your page.

##Usage
**Use the icon if:**

- You want to display an icon for illustrative purposes only, without interaction states, acting as a non-interactive icon/pictogram.
- You intend to pair the icon with another method of communication i.e. with text or a tooltip.


Note: If an icon needs to be selected or have any interaction states, it is recommended to use the transparent button style. See **Button** for more details on how to implement it.
