## What is Fundamental Library Styles?

Fundamental Library Styles is a light-weight presentation layer that can be used with your UI framework of choice (e.g. Angular, React, Vue, etc.). With Fundamental Library Stylesâ€™ library of stylesheets and HTML tags, developers can build consistent Fiori apps in any web-based technology.

**Learn more at http://sap.github.io/fundamental-styles/**

We are also working on [Angular](https://github.com/SAP/fundamental-ngx), [React](https://github.com/SAP/fundamental-react) and [Vue](https://github.com/SAP/fundamental-vue) implementations.


## Getting Started
The library is modular so you can use as little or as much as you need.

### CDN
The fully compiled, minified library is available via CDN for inclusion in your application.

```
<link href="//unpkg.com/fundamental-styles@latest/dist/fundamental-styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

### NPM Package

The compiled CSS for the full library and modules, e.g., core, layout, etc., are distributed via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fundamental-styles).

````
npm install fundamental-styles --save
````

> NOTE: We only distribute the fonts, icons and compiled CSS for each component, not the full project or HTML for specific components.

1. **Serve the development playground locally**: `npm run start:playground`

### Project Dependencies

* Docker (for running the visual regression testing framework)

### Few differences between Fundamental Library Styles and [Fundamental](https://github.com/SAP/fundamental)

Fundamental Library Styles is aiming to deliver:
* [Fiori 3.0](https://www.sap.com/products/fiori.html) compliant components
* themable components built on top of [SAP Theming Base Content](https://github.com/SAP/theming-base-content) by consuming the CSS Custom Properties delivered by the theming library
* self-contained components(each component style file contains all the styling needed to be rendered properly and at the same time avoid external styling bleeding in and bleading out. `Bleading in` means that global reset wouldn't affect the component and `bleading out` means that the component styling should not affect other HTML elements) 
* An html reference specification that consuming libraries must adhere to.
* Accessibility support
  * Accessibility - Color contrast support for WCAG 2.0 level AA (4.5:1 for typical text)
  * Accessibility - Semantic HTML reference
  * Accessibility - Aria attributes noted when possible in HTML reference

This library is also being consumed by [Fundamental Library for Angular](https://github.com/SAP/fundamental-ngx), [Fundamental Library for React](https://github.com/SAP/fundamental-react), and [Fundamental Library for Vue](https://github.com/SAP/fundamental-vue).

## Versioning

The `fundamental-styles` library follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). These components strictly adhere to the `[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]` numbering system (also known as `[BREAKING].[FEATURE].[FIX]`).

The following circumstances will be considered a MAJOR or BREAKING change:
* Droppping existing classnames, css variables, color names, color groups, spacing parameters
* The existing underlying HTML markup of a component is altered
* An existing unit test is altered to account for either of the above

The following circumstances will NOT be considered a MAJOR or BREAKING change:
* Introducing new  classnames, css variables, color names, color groups, spacing parameters
* Non-visual HTML attribute changes/additions (such as `role`, `aria-*`, `data-*`)
* Adding or modifying CSS properties and values of existing classnames.
