SAP UI Common CSS Package

## What is SAP UI Common CSS?

SAP UI Common CSS Package is a set of utility classes and SCSS mixins that allow developers to add padding, margin, color, font, shadow, and more to their applications and controls without writing custom css.
The class naming follows the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology and the values of the CSS rules are based on SAP Fiori Design Guidelines. Further customization is possible by using the SCSS mixins and providing user defined values as parameters. SCSS Mixins help in defining styles that can be re-used throughout the project's stylesheet.
