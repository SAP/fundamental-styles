<TOC>: the table of content which shows all the titles and subtitles along with the number of the page destination
<InfoLabels>: displays the information of the label
<Description>: gives longer and more detailed information about the composition
<VisibleStories>: gives an overview of the stories shown on the page
<Versions>: displays all the older versions of the page in a list
