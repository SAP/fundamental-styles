BTP button is an overstyle over the Button(Horizon) and is intended to be used within the controls and patterns for the BTP area.
BTP overstyling adds several different use-cases on top of the button from Horizon:
- Two additional button types: `tool header` and `nested`
- Badges require to not have a content in them and `fd-button--btp` class is required to be used when badges are applied.
